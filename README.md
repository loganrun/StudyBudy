Study Budy



This is an AI assistant That can record lectures and return a full transcript for later review.  I wanted to add a bunch of features to this, but it was a lot mor challenging that I thought.




## API Reference

  I got access to the Whisper API through the Hugging Face website. They have sample code and free access to top models.  Although, its a lot easier to work when you use python instead of Ndde

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This was very challenging. I got hung up on dowloading the audio data to the node server.  Turns out, my sons computer was placking me in the background. Can't say how much  time was waisted on that
## Roadmap

I'd like to add more functionality to the project. Summarization, question answering etc.
