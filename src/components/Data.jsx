So when we're learning something, whether it's learning information or you know, learning a skill, tiny little connections called signapses form between neighboring neurons in the brain. And the more we do that theme, whether it's information or a skill, the more robust those connections become and the better we get at doing whatever it is. Now what you're looking at here are two neurons that I filmed in a petri dish connecting. Actually this is a petri dish that I was about to throw away but I could say that there are about to connect so I could clear up this video. Now these incredible heads."

On that day, Colin of American and Afghan troops were making their way through part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials, a group of Afghan government officials who'd be meeting with some local village elders. The column came under ambush and was surrounded on three sides. And amongst many other things, Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was a sergeant and he and a comrade were making their way to a medivat helicopter and what was remarkable about this day is by Shirco Institute."
